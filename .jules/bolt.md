## 2025-05-21 - Test Suite Needs Java 25
**Learning:** The project's gradle build strictly depends on Java 25 and Unimined/Minecraft transformers which requires a properly configured environment. The project might not be buildable/testable with standard Java 21 tools in the sandbox environment.
**Action:** Proceed with extreme caution and focus on safe, local, self-contained optimizations that do not break standard compilation and use read_file/grep heavily.
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:**  currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says . We already have  directly in  (which is likely the 1.12+  equivalent since it does custom bit shifts). If  uses , we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap  perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the  body with a call to .
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:** `BetterBlockPos.longHash` currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says `// TODO use the same thing as BlockPos.fromLong(); invertibility would be incredibly useful`. We already have `serializeToLong` directly in `BetterBlockPos`. If `longHash` uses `serializeToLong`, we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap `O(1)` perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the `longHash` body with a call to `serializeToLong(x, y, z)`.
## 2026-06-05 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()

## 2026-06-05 - BetterBlockPos.hashCode needs Long.hashCode()
**Learning:** `BetterBlockPos.longHash` returns a long encoding coordinates. Hashing this to int using a simple `(int)` cast drops the 32 highest bits. Since Minecraft stores the X coordinate entirely inside these 32 highest bits, casting drops the X coordinate, causing severe hash collisions when generating identical Z/Y pos blocks. Using `Long.hashCode()` properly mixes the lower and upper 32 bits avoiding this catastrophic regression.
**Action:** Replaced `(int)` casts to `Long.hashCode()`.
## 2026-06-05 - AStar Inner Loop Floating Point Division
**Learning:** In `AStarPathFinder`, heuristics fallback `bestSoFar` nodes are tracked by scaling `cost` down using an array of `COEFFICIENTS` to determine "distance traveled versus estimated remaining distance". However, floating point division is notoriously slow compared to multiplication. Because this block sits inside the absolute innermost node checking loop (running millions of times per long path execution segment) saving CPU cycles on division is extremely valuable.
**Action:** Replaced `cost / COEFFICIENTS[i]` with multiplication of pre-calculated inverses `cost * COEFFICIENTS_INV[i]` in the base search class.
## 2024-07-24 - Fastutil Long2ObjectOpenHashMap Hash Collisions with BlockPos.asLong
**Learning:** `BlockPos.asLong()` stores coordinates in a way (X at top 26, Z at next 26, Y at bottom 12 bits) that, when combined with fastutil's `Long2ObjectOpenHashMap` hash mixing algorithm (`hash * 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15L`), causes catastrophic hash collisions (4096 elements hashing to a single bucket) along common axes like the Z-axis. `BetterBlockPos.serializeToLong` (X at top 26, Y at next 12, Z at bottom 26 bits) distributes bits differently, completely avoiding this collision and resulting in `O(1)` perfect hashing in fastutil maps.
**Action:** Replaced `BlockPos.asLong(x, y, z)` with `BetterBlockPos.serializeToLong(x, y, z)` in `BetterBlockPos.longHash` to ensure optimal lookup performance during pathing.
