## 2025-05-21 - Test Suite Needs Java 25
**Learning:** The project's gradle build strictly depends on Java 25 and Unimined/Minecraft transformers which requires a properly configured environment. The project might not be buildable/testable with standard Java 21 tools in the sandbox environment.
**Action:** Proceed with extreme caution and focus on safe, local, self-contained optimizations that do not break standard compilation and use read_file/grep heavily.
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:**  currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says . We already have  directly in  (which is likely the 1.12+  equivalent since it does custom bit shifts). If  uses , we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap  perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the  body with a call to .
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:** `BetterBlockPos.longHash` currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says `// TODO use the same thing as BlockPos.fromLong(); invertibility would be incredibly useful`. We already have `serializeToLong` directly in `BetterBlockPos`. If `longHash` uses `serializeToLong`, we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap `O(1)` perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the `longHash` body with a call to `serializeToLong(x, y, z)`.

## 2026-06-05 - BetterBlockPos.hashCode needs Long.hashCode()
**Learning:** `BetterBlockPos.longHash` returns a long encoding coordinates. Hashing this to int using a simple `(int)` cast drops the 32 highest bits. Since Minecraft stores the X coordinate entirely inside these 32 highest bits, casting drops the X coordinate, causing severe hash collisions when generating identical Z/Y pos blocks. Using `Long.hashCode()` properly mixes the lower and upper 32 bits avoiding this catastrophic regression.
**Action:** Replaced `(int)` casts to `Long.hashCode()`.
## 2026-06-05 - AStar Inner Loop Floating Point Division
**Learning:** In `AStarPathFinder`, heuristics fallback `bestSoFar` nodes are tracked by scaling `cost` down using an array of `COEFFICIENTS` to determine "distance traveled versus estimated remaining distance". However, floating point division is notoriously slow compared to multiplication. Because this block sits inside the absolute innermost node checking loop (running millions of times per long path execution segment) saving CPU cycles on division is extremely valuable.
**Action:** Replaced `cost / COEFFICIENTS[i]` with multiplication of pre-calculated inverses `cost * COEFFICIENTS_INV[i]` in the base search class.

## 2024-05-24 - Half-Exchange Optimization in Priority Queues
**Learning:** In highly-optimized algorithms like Baritone's A* pathfinding, traditional sift-up and sift-down implementations for binary heaps perform 2-3 memory writes inside the inner loop (e.g., swapping values and updating reference indices). The "half-exchange" optimization defers these writes by bubbling up the "hole" and assigning the target value into the final hole location only *once* at the very end of the loop, significantly saving CPU cache operations during thousands of iterations per pathfind.
**Action:** Always check loop internals in performance-critical data structures (like priority queues or custom sorts) to defer memory writes and reference updates until after the search/sift is completed.
