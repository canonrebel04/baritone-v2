## 2025-05-21 - Test Suite Needs Java 25
**Learning:** The project's gradle build strictly depends on Java 25 and Unimined/Minecraft transformers which requires a properly configured environment. The project might not be buildable/testable with standard Java 21 tools in the sandbox environment.
**Action:** Proceed with extreme caution and focus on safe, local, self-contained optimizations that do not break standard compilation and use read_file/grep heavily.
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:**  currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says . We already have  directly in  (which is likely the 1.12+  equivalent since it does custom bit shifts). If  uses , we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap  perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the  body with a call to .
## 2025-05-21 - BetterBlockPos.longHash could be BlockPos.asLong()
**Learning:** `BetterBlockPos.longHash` currently uses a custom prime multiplier approach, but the comment says `// TODO use the same thing as BlockPos.fromLong(); invertibility would be incredibly useful`. We already have `serializeToLong` directly in `BetterBlockPos`. If `longHash` uses `serializeToLong`, we guarantee 0 collisions (it's a bijection) which makes the HashMap `O(1)` perfect hashing. This is exactly the kind of optimization that matters for A* search algorithms which perform millions of map lookups.
**Action:** Replace the `longHash` body with a call to `serializeToLong(x, y, z)`.
## 2025-05-21 - Hash Code Truncation in BetterBlockPos.longHash
**Learning:** In several classes mapping coordinates, `BetterBlockPos.longHash(x, y, z)` was being cast to `(int)` before multiplying by a prime number. Because the 64-bit long uses the top 26 bits for the X coordinate, this cast simply truncates the top 32 bits, severely corrupting the hash for different X coordinates and leading to numerous map lookup collisions during A* pathfinding.
**Action:** Use `Long.hashCode(BetterBlockPos.longHash(x, y, z))` instead of casting to `(int)`. This guarantees that all bits are folded correctly into the 32-bit hash code.
